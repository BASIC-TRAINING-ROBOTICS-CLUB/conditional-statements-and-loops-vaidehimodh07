Acceleration Due to Gravity Calculator

Task: Implement a program that calculates the acceleration due to gravity based on the height from which an object is dropped. 
Use the free-fall equations to determine the gravity value and validate it against known values.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
